# C++ Pre-requisites to get you started

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.

> This series is not a single language constricted, but, a basic knowledge of C++ would help you throughout.
