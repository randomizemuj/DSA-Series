# Sorting
Sorting Algorithms are methods of reorganizing a large number of items into some specific order such as highest to lowest, or vice-versa, or even in some alphabetical order.

These algorithms take an input list, processes it (i.e, performs some operations on it) and produce the sorted list.

The most common example we experience every day is sorting clothes or other items on an e-commerce website either by lowest-price to highest, or list by popularity, or some other order.

# Searching
The searching algorithms are used to search or find one or more than one element from a dataset. These type of algorithms are used to find elements from a specific data structures.
Searching may be sequential or not. If the data in the dataset is random (_not sorted_), then we need to use sequential searching. Otherwise we can use other different techniques to reduce the complexity.  

This week, we'll be covering the following search algorithms: 
* [Linear Search]()
* [Binary Search]()
* [Jump Search]()
* [Interpolation Search]()
* [Exponential Search]()
* [Ternary Search]()
